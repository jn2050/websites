    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <h2>Machine Learning development is based on creating and training Models that are able to make predictions of new data (ex: sales in the future).
A Model is a mathematical function that transforms the input (known data such as a medical image) into a prediction (has or has not cancer). 
For modern projects the Model is too complex to be defined or programmed by humans, so it is developed by the machine itself through training.
Training consists on showing the model historical input data and the corresponding known results and make it learn through specific technics.
Done properly the Model learns from data and generalizes, and is able to make accurate predictions on new data never seen before.
